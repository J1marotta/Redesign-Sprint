      <h5>Our Focus</h5> My Focus on this redesign, was to update the colour scheme and move toward an online store.

      <p> The original webpage ("Mikepawleysports.com.au") focuses heavy on store location and the charity work they do with happy days charity, In fact it actuallys feels as if the colour scheme was chosen directly because of the charity colour scheme.</p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately this bright orange, is very dated and generally unappealing.</p>
      <p> My resdesign would focus on much more neutral colour schemes, with bright colour highlights.</p>

      <h5>Features List</h5>
      <p>To start our redesign, I made a list of required features we need for the new site. Taking into account the original focus on the charity, and our new focus of an online store.
      </p>

      <p> We want to move away from the raised menu and toward flat design, with seamless scrolling and a full cart. accessability to all features within a few clicks and a large focus on the current trends before the fold.

      <h5>Paper Sketch and Research</h5>
      <p>An Important part of the visualisation process involved comparing other sites and investigating design trends, and then planning it out on paper</p>

      <p> Two of the main influences I looked at were Paul's warehouse which is another local retailer which is now closing all their stores to go fully online. </p>

      <p> And Nike.com, who is a juggernaut of fashion and they focus on newest trends and fashions.</p>


      <p> The Takeaways from these sites was that we needed large images before the fold, and a centre page slider, with the newest addition. Also heavy focus on flat design moving away from gradients and raised images.</p>

      <p> Below I have collected some images from the landing pages of those two sites.</p>

    <div class="flex-item-wireframe-right">
      <p>After Sketching out the design by hand, it was time to move to prototyping a wireframe.
      I used Figma.com.au, as it is easy to learn and free.</p>

      <p>Taking into account the heavy focus from the original website I made it very easy to access a local store including a map and contact us page.</p>

      <p> before the fold was focused on integrating the online store, and image heavy.</p>

    <div class="mobile">
      <p> For the mobile wireframe, I focused on continuous scrolling with easy access to the cart. </p>
      <p> Big focus on the online store and easy access to other features by swipping from the left or touching the hamburger</p>

  <div class="flex-item-moodboard-side">
    <p>The mood I was going for with the site focused, on bright colours as highlights, to a flat design.</p>

    <p>As the plan was to move more toward an online store, colours would be used to highlight new product features and sale items.</p>

 <div class="flex-item-moodboard-side">
   <p>The original colour scheme seemed entirely based on affiliation with the happy days Charity.
   We would move to cleaner tones, flat design away from the dated nav bar as well.</p>
