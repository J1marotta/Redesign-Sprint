1. Pick a website to redesign

2. List the neccessary features the new site will need (ex. Sign In? Shop?)

3. Sketch on paper

4. Wireframe on your computer (Axure, Figma, Balsamiq, or whatever you want)

5. Research colours/typography --- don't focus on what you are selling,
but you are thinking about who is your audience and what would thy like visually?

6. Make a mood board with Pinterest (just a collection of inspirational photos)

7. Pick colours and typography based on your reserach and mood board --
these are your brand assets

8. TOMORROW: You will be compiling the whole process into a beautifully
formatted and designed index.html file which will be part of your final
portfolio for job hunting. You will present the whole design process and
explain WHY you made these decisions!
